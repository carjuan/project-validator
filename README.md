# Educational Web Projects Validation Tool

As an instructor, validating web projects that include web technologies (CSS, HTML,
JavaScript, etc) making such validation requires little to none manual intervention.
Most of the work people do is checking if HTML markup is correct (W3CValidator) and
students have met project specifications. This process
can be automated.

You still need to verify results and markup validation or any other output from this tool.
But this process cuts time and resources from instructors. Specially for web developer
instructors.

## Project Status

This project is very early in development.

## General Information

It is a very simple tool that:

-   Checks students `root folder` to check if provided folder meets projects specifications
-   Validates `HTML markup` and `CSS`

<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Technologies Used

-   Shell Script **_(ZSH)_**

## Features (WIP)

-   Validates HTML markup
-   Validates simple web projects specifications

## Wishlist

-   Runs [MOSS](https://theory.stanford.edu/~aiken/moss/) against all students folders
    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > You have to get your own account and in the script sent by email, there will be a 7 digit
    > number that you will need to setup script that works for you.
    -   Installation and setup with [MOSS](https://theory.stanford.edu/~aiken/moss/) coming
        later **_(WIP)_**
-   Validates Vanilla JavaScript
-   Access to OpenAI APIs to interpret data from `W3CValidator`
    -   Provides meaningful results and examples on how to fix common mistakes found in
        their work.
-   (Undecided) Move to `node.js` for easier scripting and API management.
